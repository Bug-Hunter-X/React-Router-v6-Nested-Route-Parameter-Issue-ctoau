This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router v6 related to nested routes with parameters.  The issue occurs when a nested route attempts to access parameters passed to its parent route. The nested route ignores the parameters, leading to unexpected rendering behavior.  The solution provides a corrected implementation that properly handles parameter inheritance in nested routes.
